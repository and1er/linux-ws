# Local WSL VM

Windows 10 case to use Linux inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) instead of fully fledged VM.
I know WSL doesn't cover all use-cases as pure VM, but for some simple usages it could be enough.

For now it's in my separate repository [wsl-debian-settings](https://github.com/and1er/wsl-debian-settings),
but I would move it here.
